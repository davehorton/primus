This document provides instructions on how to install the point of sale reporting software for the Pactolus prepaid database.

PREREQUISITES:

1) You must have the gzip file containing the reporting software.  
Alternatively, using the directions below, you can check out and build the components from source.

2) You must have a Linux server from which to run the software.  
This server must have network access to the database server you will be reporting on.

INSTALLATION STEPS:

1) Unzip and untar the distribution file into a directory of your choosing.

2) Edit the beans.xml file to point to the correct database by changing the second line below, if necessary:

<property name="connectionURL">
       <value>jdbc:oracle:thin:@10.201.174.136:1521:psprd1</value> 
</property>

3) Edit the log4j.properties file to point to a log file and directory of your choosing, by editing this line:

log4j.appender.A2.File=/export/home/pcs/newPosReporting/logs/posReporting.log

4) Make sure the file named 'runReport.sh' is executable:

chmod +x runReport.sh

5) Now you are ready to run the report.  To run a report for yesterday, execute the following command:

./runReport.sh --start -1 --end 0

To view the possible date options, simply run the script with no parameters:

./runReport

If desired, create a cron entry similar to the one below to run the report each morning:

30 03 * * * /usr/bin/bash -c "/export/home/pcs/newPosReporting/runReport.sh >/export/home/pcs/newPosReporting/logs/newPosReporting.out 2>&1"
